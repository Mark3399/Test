Steps of building this app:

1. Understanding how Apollo/GraphQL queries work and fetching the data
2. Thinking about wether to use Tailwind or Antd for styling but then I thought I would use pure CSS since you mentioned you do as well and doing some basic layout for the page and components structure
3. Displaying the fetched posts data, here initially I got the wrong idea of how this app should look like hence I created a list of the posts cause I thought I would need to select them and display some graphs for each post.
4. Find an example for Visx online and fix it to work in my app
5. Get the necessary data required for the graphs from my raw fetched data and put them into the graph component
6. Trying to make the app look prettier but then I realised my pure CSS skills are bad since not using it for quite a long time
7. Add another graph
